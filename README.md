# generic_growing_array_c

I am new to C and coming from C++ and Java I miss having a data structure, such as, vectors and arraylists.  So I thought I would experiment with this in C so that I could utilize the benefits of a dynamic growing array.  I tried to go further and make it work generically with any data type.  However, this seems to have made this data structure error prone.  I would like to continue to develop this to have more useful functions.
